ATM Simulation System

Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop an ATM Simulation System in Java that simulates the basic functionalities of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). The system should provide a user-friendly interface for customers to perform common banking operations such as withdrawals, deposits, balance inquiries, and account transfers.


User Interface:
Develop a user-friendly console-based interface for customers to interact with the ATM system.
Display appropriate messages and options for users at each step of the transaction.

User Varification:
Users should be able to log in using a unique identifier (e.g., Card Number) and a confidential Personal Identification Number (PIN).
Implement security measures to prevent unauthorized access.

Account Operations:
Balance Inquiry: Users should be able to check their account balance.
Cash Withdrawal: Users should be able to withdraw a specified amount of money from their account.
Cash Deposit: Users should be able to deposit a specified amount of money into their account.

Account Transfers:
Users should be able to transfer money between their own accounts or to another account within the bank.

Error Handling:
Implement robust error handling to address scenarios such as insufficient funds, incorrect PIN, invalid account numbers, etc.

Security:
Ensure that sensitive information (e.g., PIN, account balances) is stored securely.
Implement measures to protect against unauthorized access and fraudulent activities.

Documentation:
Include clear and concise documentation for the code, including comments for better understanding.
Provide a user manual explaining how to use the ATM Simulation System.
